This lab took us about an hour and a half to two hours, and we were able to complete it without too much difficulty. One difficulty we faced during this labwas working with zoom. It was somewhat difficult to tell eachother what we thought we should do and make sure we were both contributing to the code. After the first half hour though we were able to figure out how to best work through the lab and work together well.
