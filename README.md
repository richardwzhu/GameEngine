This lab took us about an hour and a half to two hours, and we were able to complete it without too much difficulty. One difficulty we faced during this labwas working with zoom. It was somewhat difficult to tell eachother what we thought we should do and make sure we were both contributing to the code. After the first half hour though we were able to figure out how to best work through the lab and work together well.

We worked together to complete the first part of HW2, then split up to do the rest of the lab. Richard comleted the first 2 independant assignments, and I did the last one. Along the way we both discovered some issues with the code that we worked together to fix. Overall I spent about 2 hours on the content of this weeks homework.
